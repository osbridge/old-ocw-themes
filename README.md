Old OpenConferenceWare Themes
=============================

These are themes extracted from the Rails 2.1 version of [OpenConferenceWare](https://github.com/osbridge/openconferenceware). The current (engine-based) version of OCW doesn't support multiple themes, but allows views to be overridden by the host application.

## bridgepdx

This is the currently-deployed theme for [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org).

## default

An outdated attempt at a generic default theme.
